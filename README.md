Fall 2020 Repository for Audio for Digital Games at NYU!


WEEK 3 ASSIGNMENT
-----
DUE Monday, September 21 at 4 pm.  
Note that the syllabus also has a listening assignment, but I'm going to incorporate a bit of that into the video that I'm making.

Choose 2 video clips from [THIS FOLDER](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sb_F2S-Yw5tFaW-Y55rt1VXSnXP3-WOE/view?usp=sharing).  If you want, you can find your own, provided that they are roughly 10 seconds long and contains a decent amount of gameplay footage (more than just footsteps).

Add sound effects to accompany the gifs.  The goal for the first pass is to have a distinct sound for every distinct motion - try to make it believable, as if the motions in the gif are producing the sound. 

Then, do a "second pass."  Choose different source material, and take a different artistic direction.  Try to still have sound for almost every motion, but go against convention! 

Render these (there should be 4 total) as WEBM videos and [upload them here when you're done](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jvjoJ3HUWcMMyps0ms-OdQQZTIyXClmW?usp=sharing).  Make a sub-folder with your name.


WEEK 2 ASSIGNMENTS
------


DUE Monday, September 14 at 4 pm.  This assignment is also avalable [AT THIS LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-brqxZFMzU7TiCHPviXjwtxdSyuLEn5Pa6WXwRQ5lkc/edit?usp=sharing), where you can respond in writing if you wish.

**Creating:** Make a 1-3 minute "Sound Story" In Reaper, and upload it [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LbdIesTbLyCatF_265w0hd8fuylM9vT4?usp=sharing).  

It might help to start with a setting that you want to convey, or some kind of scenario (like.. a LARP Battle in the Forest, or a High Speed Bicyle Chase), or you can just grab a bunch of different sounds and make an audio collage!  Try to Experiment with changes in Envelopes, Pitch, Panning, and Volume to tell your story.  

**Reading** [John Cage - Lecture on Nothing](https://seansturm.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/john-cage-lecture-on-nothing.pdf)

Read the first 3 pages

Consider or respond in writing:
 - Read a bit of the piece out loud, taking care to wait when there is space on the page
 - Py attention to the sounds that you hear in pauses between the words.  What do you hear?
 - Is this more a piece of music?  Of poetry?  Of just sounds?
 
**Listening:** [The Art Ensemble of Chicago - Illistrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxjf54tsWEc)

Consider or respond in writing:
  - How many different instruments can you count in this piece?  Where do they use more tonal sounds?  More noisey ones?
  - How do you think the instruments and sound effects relate to the story?  Is it complementing the story?  Setting the scene?  Following the emotional arc?  
  - Are there moments where you think the instruments feel completely in sync with the storyteller?  or completely detached?



WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENTS
------

Reading - [Seeing Circles Signs & Signals: “Intro, Signals & Sound” & “Sines & Sampling”](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/)

Some questions to consider:
 - Where else have you heard the term "aliasing"?  Can you think of any time that you experienced "aliasing" and what it did?
 - What are some reasons we might "over-sample" audio?  Think about the ways we might be manipulating audio to create sound effects.
 - What are some reasons we might "under-sample" audio?  These might be practical decisions, or an aesthetic ones.
 - What is the lowest frequency range that we can record speech and still distinguish words?  Why do you think this is?

Listening - [Tristan Perich: 1-Bit Symphony](https://tristanperich.bandcamp.com/album/1-bit-symphony) - at least Movement 1.  TURN YOUR SOUND DOWN.

Things to consider when listening:
 - The reading had to do with frequencies, which affect sample _rate_ .  This music is constrained by bit depth, which restricts each sample's _amplitude_.
 - What does "1-bit" mean?  Why do you think the composer adopted this constraint?  What are some ways this piece generates variety using only 1 bit?  
 - Do you hear more pitches, or more noises in this piece?  Are there any places that seem more pitchy or more noisey?
 - How does this piece make you feel?  Do you associate it with any places, objects, or times? Or maybe other games, film, or music you've heard? 

If you wish, record some responses [On This Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tRf_EwWJEI-p0qJuVaWIUiVvEZSH8LivPGvi1lVtUEQ/edit?usp=sharing), or be prepared to share yours in class on **Wednesday, September 9**



**Active Listening Presentation - Due in class at some point in the semester**
with a partner, play a game from the provided list, [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hqdDCL9Sxn1z2aqPhcGguGxTOhXIV_HvDg4cryX9pDI/edit?usp=sharing), or make a case for a different game.  I ask that you don't watch a let's play, but I'll make exceptions if it's a specific kind of let's play relevant to audio or accessibility, or the game is not available anymore.  You might start by listing the sounds that you hear in the game, and rank them by importance.  How do you determing "important sounds" and how does the game distinguish these from the rest? How would you describe the overall audio aesthetic, mood, or feeling of the game?  How do sounds change in response to player action (some sounds may be randomized, or connected to in-game physics in interesting ways)?  Look up some facts about the creation of the game audio - what’s interesting about the techniques or technology used?

You will be presenting a brief (~7 minute) presentation during a lab time; please schedule your time in that sheet by **September 9**.  It's ok if you don't know which game you want to do quite yet.  If you have the means, please record this to a video.  Otherwise, make sure to make share your slides before class so we can view any video examples without Zoom compression.

You can share slides, resources, videos, or other interesting finds [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I7tUAb3LxKi-FKV1gSQNQwZGOVw0iQFn?usp=sharing)
