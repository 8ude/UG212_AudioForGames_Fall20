# UG212_AudioForGames_Fall20
Fall 2020 Repository for Audio for Digital Games at NYU!

WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENTS
------

Reading - [Seeing Circles Signs & Signals: “Intro, Signals & Sound” & “Sines & Sampling”](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/)

Some questions to consider:
 - Where else have you heard the term "aliasing"?  Can you think of any time that you experienced "aliasing" and what it did?
 - What are some reasons we might "over-sample" audio?  Think about the ways we might be manipulating audio to create sound effects.
 - What are some reasons we might "under-sample" audio?  These might be practical decisions, or an aesthetic ones.
 - What is the lowest frequency range that we can record speech and still distinguish words?  Why do you think this is?

Listening - [Tristan Perich: 1-Bit Symphony](https://tristanperich.bandcamp.com/album/1-bit-symphony) - at least Movement 1.  TURN YOUR SOUND DOWN.

Things to consider when listening:
 - The reading had to do with frequencies, which affect sample _rate_ .  This music is constrained by bit depth, which restricts each sample's _amplitude_.
 - What does "1-bit" mean?  Why do you think the composer adopted this constraint?  What are some ways this piece generates variety using only 1 bit?  
 - Do you hear more pitches, or more noises in this piece?  Are there any places that seem more pitchy or more noisey?
 - How does this piece make you feel?  Do you associate it with any places, objects, or times? Or maybe other games, film, or music you've heard? 

Record some responses [On This Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tRf_EwWJEI-p0qJuVaWIUiVvEZSH8LivPGvi1lVtUEQ/edit?usp=sharing), or be prepared to share yours in class on **Wednesday, September 9**



**Active Listening Presentation - Due in class at some point in the semester**
with a partner, play a game from the provided list, [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hqdDCL9Sxn1z2aqPhcGguGxTOhXIV_HvDg4cryX9pDI/edit?usp=sharing), or make a case for a different game.  I ask that you don't watch a let's play, but I'll make exceptions if it's a specific kind of let's play relevant to audio or accessibility, or the game is not available anymore.  You might start by listing the sounds that you hear in the game, and rank them by importance.  How do you determing "important sounds" and how does the game distinguish these from the rest? How would you describe the overall audio aesthetic, mood, or feeling of the game?  How do sounds change in response to player action (some sounds may be randomized, or connected to in-game physics in interesting ways)?  Look up some facts about the creation of the game audio - what’s interesting about the techniques or technology used?

You will be presenting a brief (~7 minute) presentation during a lab time; please schedule your time in that sheet by **September 9**.  It's ok if you don't know which game you want to do quite yet.  If you have the means, please record this to a video.  Otherwise, make sure to make share your slides before class so we can view any video examples without Zoom compression.

For Friday’s Lab section, bring in 3 sounds from a game project that you’ve worked on.
